        <h1>Top 5 Most Popular Programming Languages</h1>

        <h3>1. Python</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Number of jobs:</b> 89,956
            <br />
            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $120,000<br />
            <br />
            <b>Benefits:</b>Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++.
            In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. <i>“You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.”</i> It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.
        </p>
        <p><b>Drawbacks:</b> Python is not suitable for mobile application development.</p>
        <p><b>Common uses: </b>Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.</p>

        <h3>2. JavaScript</h3>
        <p><b>Number of jobs: </b>68,889<br />

            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $118,000
        </p>
        <p><b>Benefits: </b> JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; <i>“virtually everyone is using it,”</i> Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. </p>

        <p><b>Drawbacks: </b> Internet browsers can disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious content. </p>
        <p><b>Common uses: </b> JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based applications, which do not require users to download an application.</p>

        <h3>3. Java</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Number of jobs: </b> 1,00,394<br />
            <b>Average annual salary: </b> $104,000
        </p>
        <p><b>Benefits: </b>Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.</p>
        <p><b>Drawbacks: </b> Java is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed to the server (which is common for business applications). In addition, the software company Oracle, which owns Java, charges a licensing fee to use the Java Development Kit.</p>

        <p><b>Common uses:</b>Along with business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile operating system.</p>

        <h3>4. C#</h3>
        <p><b>Number of jobs: </b>20,894<br />
            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $97,000
        </p>
        <p><b>Benefits:</b>Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C. It is fully integrated with Microsoft’s .NET software framework, which supports the development of applications for Windows, browser plug-ins, and mobile devices. C# offers shared codebases, a large code library, and a variety of data types.</p>
        <p><b>Drawbacks:</b>C# can have a steep learning curve, especially for resolving errors. It is less flexible than languages such as C++. </p>
        <p><b>Common uses: </b>C# is the go-to language for Microsoft ad Windows application development. It can also be used for mobile devices and video game consoles using an extension of the .NET Framework called Mono.</p>

        <h3>5. C</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Number of jobs:</b>37,785<br />
