        <h3>What is a programming language?</h3>
        <p>A programming language consists of a vocabulary containing a set of grammatical rules intended to convey instructions to a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <p>Each programming language has an unique set of keywords along with a special syntax to organize the softwareâ€™s instructions.</p>
        <p>There are low-level and high-level programming languages which, although simple compared to human languages, are more complex than machine languages.</p>
        <h3>Differences between natural language and programming language</h3>
        <p>Natural language is the language spoken by people, while programming language is intended for machines. Both languages contain important similarities, such as the differentiation they make between syntax and semantics, their purpose to communicate and the existence of a basic composition.</p>
        <p>Whilst there are several similarities and points in common, for example, the two types were created to communicate ideas, expressions, and instructions, it is also possible to identify some differences.</p>
        <h3>Main features of programming languages</h3>
        <p>The popularity of a programming language depends on the features and utilities it provides to programmers. The features that a programming language must have to stand out are the following:</p>
        <li><b>Simplicity: </b>The language must offer clear and simple concepts that facilitate learning and application, in a way that is simple to understand and maintain. Simplicity is a difficult balance to strike without compromise the overall capabilty .</li>
        <li><b>Naturalness: </b>This means that its application in the area for which it was designed must be done naturally, providing operators, structures and syntax for operators to work efficiently. </li>
        <li><b>Abstraction: </b>It is the ability to define and use complicated structures or operations while ignoring certain low level details. </li>
        <li><b>Efficiency: </b> Programming languages must be translated and executed efficiently so as not to consume too much memory or require too much time.</li>
        <li><b>Structuring: </b> The language allows programmers to write their code according to structured programming concepts, to avoid creating errors.</li>
        <li><b>Compactness: </b> With this characteristic, it is possible to express operations concisely, without having to write too many details.</li>
        <li><b>Locality: </b>Refers to the code concentrating on the part of the program with which you are working at a given time.</li>
