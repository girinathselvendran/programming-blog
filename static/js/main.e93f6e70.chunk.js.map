Both languages contain important similarities, such as the differentiation they make between syntax and semantics, their purpose to communicate and the existence of a basic composition.</p>\r\n        <p>Whilst there are several similarities and points in common, for example, the two types were created to communicate ideas, expressions, and instructions, it is also possible to identify some differences.</p>\r\n        <h3>Main features of programming languages</h3>\r\n        <p>The popularity of a programming language depends on the features and utilities it provides to programmers. The features that a programming language must have to stand out are the following:</p>\r\n        <li><b>Simplicity: </b>The language must offer clear and simple concepts that facilitate learning and application, in a way that is simple to understand and maintain. Simplicity is a difficult balance to strike without compromise the overall capabilty .</li>\r\n        <li><b>Naturalness: </b>This means that its application in the area for which it was designed must be done naturally, providing operators, structures and syntax for operators to work efficiently. </li>\r\n        <li><b>Abstraction: </b>It is the ability to define and use complicated structures or operations while ignoring certain low level details. </li>\r\n        <li><b>Efficiency: </b> Programming languages must be translated and executed efficiently so as not to consume too much memory or require too much time.</li>\r\n        <li><b>Structuring: </b> The language allows programmers to write their code according to structured programming concepts, to avoid creating errors.</li>\r\n        <li><b>Compactness: </b> With this characteristic, it is possible to express operations concisely, without having to write too many details.</li>\r\n        <li><b>Locality: </b>Refers to the code concentrating on the part of the program with which you are working at a given time.</li>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nexport default Home;","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst Programming = () =>\r\n    <main className=\"programming\">\r\n        <img className=\"progam-img\" src=\"https://www.itprotoday.com/sites/itprotoday.com/files/styles/article_featured_retina/public/programming%20evolution.jpg?itok=WTj9-yNz\" alt=\"Logo\" />\r\n        <p>A programming language is mainly used to <b> develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.</b></p>\r\n        <div className=\"progrm-content\" >\r\n            <u><h3>Types of programming language</h3></u>\r\n            <h3>1. Low-level programming language</h3>\r\n            <p>Low-level language is <b> machine-dependent (0s and 1s) </b>programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.</p>\r\n            <h3>i. Machine Language\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as<b> machine code or object code.</b> Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.</p>\r\n            <h3>ii. Assembly Language</h3>\r\n            <p>Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a<b> symbolic and human-understandable form.</b> It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.</p>\r\n            <p>The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program.</p>\r\n            <h3>2. High-level programming language</h3>\r\n            <p>High-level programming language (HLL) is<b> designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.</b> This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).</p>\r\n            <p>The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is<b> easy to read, write, and maintain.</b></p>\r\n            <p>High-level programming language includes<b> Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.</b>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h3>3. Middle-level programming language\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <p>Middle-level programming language <b>lies between the low-level programming language and high-level programming language.</b> It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.</p>\r\n            <p>A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language</p>     </div>\r\n        <p><b>Example:</b> C, C++, language</p>\r\n    </main >\r\nexport default Programming;","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nconst Jobs = () =>\r\n    <div className=\"jobs\">\r\n\r\n        <img className=\"progam-img\" alt=\"progam-img\" src={\"http://content.timesjobs.com/img/84138958/Master.jpg\"} />\r\n\r\n        <h1>Top 5 Most Popular Programming Languages</h1>\r\n\r\n        <h3>1. Python</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b>Number of jobs:</b> 89,956\r\n            <br />\r\n            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $120,000<br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <b>Benefits:</b>Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++.\r\n            In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. <i>“You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.”</i> It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Drawbacks:</b> Python is not suitable for mobile application development.</p>\r\n        <p><b>Common uses: </b>Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>2. JavaScript</h3>\r\n        <p><b>Number of jobs: </b>68,889<br />\r\n\r\n            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $118,000\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Benefits: </b> JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; <i>“virtually everyone is using it,”</i> Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. </p>\r\n\r\n        <p><b>Drawbacks: </b> Internet browsers can disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious content. </p>\r\n        <p><b>Common uses: </b> JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based applications, which do not require users to download an application.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>3. Java</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b>Number of jobs: </b> 1,00,394<br />\r\n            <b>Average annual salary: </b> $104,000\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Benefits: </b>Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.</p>\r\n        <p><b>Drawbacks: </b> Java is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed to the server (which is common for business applications). In addition, the software company Oracle, which owns Java, charges a licensing fee to use the Java Development Kit.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p><b>Common uses:</b>Along with business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>4. C#</h3>\r\n        <p><b>Number of jobs: </b>20,894<br />\r\n            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $97,000\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Benefits:</b>Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C. It is fully integrated with Microsoft’s .NET software framework, which supports the development of applications for Windows, browser plug-ins, and mobile devices. C# offers shared codebases, a large code library, and a variety of data types.</p>\r\n        <p><b>Drawbacks:</b>C# can have a steep learning curve, especially for resolving errors. It is less flexible than languages such as C++. </p>\r\n        <p><b>Common uses: </b>C# is the go-to language for Microsoft ad Windows application development. It can also be used for mobile devices and video game consoles using an extension of the .NET Framework called Mono.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>5. C</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b>Number of jobs:</b>37,785<br />\r\n            <b>Average annual salary:</b> $97,000\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            <b>Benefits: </b>Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C.
